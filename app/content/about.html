	QWERTYBall is the realization of an idea I had years ago that it would be fun
	to create a twist on the classic game of
	<a

		target="_blank"
		>Breakout</a
	>
	by transposing my keyboard onto my screen so that you had to bang on the keys
	to keep the ball in play.
</p>
<p>
	For whatever reason, the idea stuck with me, so when I
	<a

		>decided to get back into programming</a
	>
	and needed a project to work on, I decided to make this game for real.
</p>
<p>
	I employed the Canvas API to dynamically draw the keyboard on the userâ€™s
	screen, and I used the Web Audio API to add original sound effects to make the
	game feel more responsive
</p>
<p>
	I hope you enjoy it. Feel free to

	any feedback!
