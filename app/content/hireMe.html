<p>
	After focusing on User Experience for years, I recently decided to get back
	into programming. In Spring 2021 I completed a

		target="_blank"
		>Software Engineering course at Flatiron School</a
	>
	and this is one of the projects I made.
</p>

<p>
	I've learned a tremendous amount about front-end engineering, backend
	engineering, and the mechanics of web applications. I'm looking forward to
	applying new programming skills and my old UX skills to a new job opportunity.
	This web app was built in Rails/React, but I'm eager to learn more programming
	languages going forward.
